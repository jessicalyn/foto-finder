## Project title
Foto-Finder
Created by Jessica Hansen (https://github.com/jessicalyn)

## Motivation
This was our first solo project where (many) Javascript functionalities were required. I was able to pull a lot of functionality and/or ideas from Idea Box to complete FotoFinder.

## Build status
Finished Phase 2.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript</b>

## Features
Just like Instagram you can save and favorite photos you love!
-Saves photos to your localStorage, so even if you refresh the page it will still be there.
-You can "heart" your favorite photos.
-Search the title and captions of the cards.
-Change the title and/or caption of your photos.

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: Still learning to feel comfortable writing JavaScript functions and understanding the error messages (or lack thereof) when they aren't working.

Biggest win: Feel more comfortable using localStorage. I think my comp looks very similar to the project comp-aside from card size on mobile.

Challenges and places for improvement:
- Continuing to learn and feel more comfortable using JavaScript
- Search is case-sensitive, didn't have time to fix
- Delete sometimes deletes wrong card from storage, thus on page load switches photos around. This seems to occur mostly when localStorage is very full
- Didn't get photo card size exactly to comp standards on mobile

## Credits
This was an individual project with many helpful team mates! I feel grateful our class is so supportive and we all worked and shared ideas together throughout the building process for FotoFinder. Couldn't have done it in the timeframe without them!
